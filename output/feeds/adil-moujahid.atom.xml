&lt;p&gt;I'm planning to use this blog to share some thoughts on topics I'm interested in. These topics are mainly centered around technology with a deep focus on data analytics and applied mathematics. I will try to keep the content focused on practical use cases with many tutorials on how to build algorithms and mathematical models for analyzing data and how to implement these models using programming languages such as Python and Java as well as new Software packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to get your comments on the blog posts and suggestions for new tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="misc"></category></entry></feed>
