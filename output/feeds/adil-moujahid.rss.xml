The term Sabermetrics comes from saber (Society for American Baseball Research) and metrics (as in econometrics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Michael Lewis published Moneyball about Billy Beane, the Oakland Athletics General Manager since 1997. The book was centered around Billy Beane's use of Sabemetrics to indentify and recruit under-valued baseball players. With this strategy, his team could achieve as many wins as teams with more than double the payroll. The  Oakland Athletics made it to the play-offs 4 successive years: 2000,2001,2002,2003. In 2011, the movie Moneyball based on Lewis' book was released starring Brad Pitt in the role of Beane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will use Lahmanâ€™s Baseball Database and Python programming language to explain some of the techniques used in Sabermetrics. I will used 2 Python libraries: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, Scipy for building statistical models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A quick introduction to Baseball rules&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm planning to use this blog to share some thoughts on topics I'm interested in. These topics are mainly centered around technology with a deep focus on data analytics and applied mathematics. I will try to keep the content focused on practical use cases with many tutorials on how to build algorithms and mathematical models for analyzing data and how to implement these models using programming languages such as Python and Java as well as new Software packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to get your comments on the blog posts and suggestions for new tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adil Moujahid</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>tag:,2014-07-08:posts/2014/07/hello-world/</guid><category>misc</category></item></channel></rss>
