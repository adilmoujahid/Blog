Summary: In this blog post, we will be using an open collection of football logs to create a web app that analyzes Messi and Ronaldo's game during LaLiga season 2017-18. We will be using Python/Jupyter notebooks to analyze the data and Python/Streamlit to create an interactive web app that compares both players stats and shows their positions on the pitch.
