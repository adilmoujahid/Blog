Summary: In this tutorial, I will combine Coursera course catalogue together with social media data to assess the popularity of courses. To to this, I will use the Coursera API to retrieve the course catalogue, I will use the sharecount.com API to get social media metrics for each course, and I will use python's ```pandas``` library to query and order the courses by popularity. The technique introduced in this tutorial can be leveraged to other use cases that require a popularity ranking system for measuring the relevance of a list of links.
