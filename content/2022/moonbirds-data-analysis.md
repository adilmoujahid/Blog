Summary: Moonbirds is the official PFP NFT project of the Proof collective. It consists of 10,000 utility-enabled PFPs that unlock different benefits depending on the traits and the locking period of the Moonbird NFT. In this blog post, we will use Python and Alchemy to do a deep dive analysis of the collection in its first week of trading.
