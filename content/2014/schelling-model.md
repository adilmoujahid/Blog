Summary: dfffffffffffffffffffffffffff

Wonder why we segregate into neighborhoods that are so homogeneous? To the casual observer, it may seem like we are racist, class sensitive, and prefer people who look like us while disliking outsiders. In fact, I recently read this assertion in a book by an author I respect, Steven Pinker.
