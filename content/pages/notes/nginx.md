###1- What is Nginx?

Nginx is a:

* Web server: A web server is server software, or a system of one or more computers dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy client HTTP requests on the public World Wide Web or also on private LANs and WANs. [[source]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server)
* Reverse proxy: A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server.[[source]](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/)
* Load balancer: A load balancer is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers. Load balancers are used to increase capacity (concurrent users) and reliability of applications. [[source]](https://www.f5.com/services/resources/glossary/load-balancer)
* Mail proxy: A mail proxy server is a stand-alone machine that is located in front of the actual email server. The mail proxy server is customized to provide any or all of the following services: Web based email via IMAP. Virus scanning. File type blocking. [[source]](http://www.real-time.com/linuxsolutions/mailproxy.html)
* HTTP cache: Caching is a technique that stores a copy of a given resource and serves it back when requested. [[source]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching)

###2- My use cases for Nginx

* Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer for applications that I’m deploying in cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, Heroku) 
* Using Nginx authentication modules to create an authentication layer that can be used with applications that I’m deploying in cloud platforms.
