title: My Projects
Slug: projects

With my personal projects, I explore emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, and generative art. Each project represents a unique challenge and opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to share my experiences and insights with you.

<!-- Selected projects section: Blockchain -->
<h2 class="content-subhead">Blockchain</h2>

<ul class="selected-projects">
    <li><a href="./projects/hello-nfts/">Hello, NFTs</a> is a project that aims at providing a comprehensive guide to creating and deploying an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain, covering all aspects of the process from start to finish.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/adilmoujahid/blockchain-python-tutorial">blockchain-python-tutorial</a> is a practical guide to implementing a basic blockchain and its client using Python. It includes features such as multiple node addition, proof of work, conflict resolution, and transactions with RSA encryption. Additionally, the project contains two dashboards, "Blockchain Frontend" for miners and "Blockchain Client" for users to generate wallets and send coins.</li>
</ul>


<!-- Selected projects section: Generative Art -->
<h2 class="content-subhead">Generative Art</h2>

<ul class="selected-projects">
    <li><a href="https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/24620">Geometric Grid Fusion</a> is my first generative art project published on the fxhash platform and the Tezos blockchain. It's inspired by the works of Piet Mondrian and Sol Lewitt, this project experiments with lines and shapes to create a unique and visually interesting composition.</li>

    <li><a href="./projects/fusion-bricks/">Fusion Bricks</a> is a project in which I aimed to explore the convergence of generative art, pixel art, and LEGO creations. To achieve this, I redeveloped my initial fxhash project, <a href="https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/24620"> Geometric Grid Fusion</a>, using Pico-8 and then chose several outputs to construct with LEGO bricks.</li>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/adilmoujahid/pfp-generator">PFP Generator</a> PFP Generator is a simple web application that allows users to create custom profile pictures by selecting different layers and traits. Users can upload images for body and trait layers, and then mix and match the layers to generate their desired profile pictures.</li>
</ul>


<!-- Selected projects section: Generative Art -->
<h2 class="content-subhead">Others</h2>

<ul class="selected-projects">
    <li><a href="https://github.com/adilmoujahid/pixel-editor">Pixel Editor</a> Pixel Editor is a simple web application that allows users to create pixel art, save their creations as assets, and import or export assets as images. Users can easily draw on a grid canvas, pick colors, and toggle the visibility of the grid.</li>
</ul>
