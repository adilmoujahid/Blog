title: About

This is a personal blog I've started to share thoughts on data analytics and applied mathematics.

I am a data scientist in NTT DATA Corporation Japan. I work on building Big Data infrastructure solutions and data analytics algorithms. I also work on business analytics projects for different vertical industries.

I hold a masters degree in Information Science and Electrical Engineering from Kyushu University - Japan. My undergraduate thesis was about the application of algorithms from information theory to financial data. During my graduate years, I worked on theoretical machine learning as well as practical application of machine learning techniques to data compression.

I also participate on a regular basis to data analytics competitions run by Kaggle.com. [Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/users/52887/adil)
