title: About

Hi there, I'm Adil Moujahid, a data scientist and technical manager at NTT DATA's Data and Intelligence team. My expertise lies in data analytics and artificial intelligence, but I also have a keen interest in blockchain technology and generative art, which I love to explore in my free time.

Through this blog, I hope to share my knowledge and personal projects in these areas and connect with other enthusiasts. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, as well as a Master of Engineering degree in Information Science and Electrical Engineering, both earned from Kyushu University in Japan.
