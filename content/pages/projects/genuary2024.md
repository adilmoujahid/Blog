title: Genuary 2024
Slug: genuary2024

Genuary is an annual challenge that combines the rigor of coding with the beauty of art, pushing participants to create a new piece of generative art each day of January. In January 2024, I embarked on this creative journey for the second time, motivated by the daily practice to sharpen my coding and artistic skills.

The challenge is not just about art; it's about discipline, learning, and connecting with a community of like-minded artists. Each day brought a new prompt, a new opportunity to explore different techniques and styles. 

Below are some highlights from my submissions, each reflecting a day’s exploration, innovation, and a personal narrative.
